An Angular 18 single-page application for managing smart city infrastructure — public buildings and their energy devices. Built as an architectural reference for **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Onion Architecture** applied to a modern Angular standalone component model.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** — `node --version`
- **npm 9+** — `npm --version`
- **Angular CLI 18** — `npm install -g @angular/cli@18`
- [SmartCity Backend](https://github.com/zaricu22/Domain-Driven-Backend) running on `http://localhost:8080` for local development

---

## Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaricu22/SmartCity-Frontend.git
cd SmartCity-Frontend
npm ci
```

Generate the local environment file (run once after cloning):

```bash
npm run setup:env
```

This creates `src/environments/environment.ts` if it does not already exist.

---

## Running Locally

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

---

## Running Tests

**Unit tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Unit tests with coverage report:**
```bash
npx jest --coverage
```
Coverage output is written to `coverage/lcov.info`. (`ng test` no longer works — the Karma
builder was removed from `angular.json` when the project migrated to Jest, see ADR-0019.)

**Architecture / DDD layer rules:**
```bash
npm run test:arch
```
Fails if any import crosses a layer boundary the Onion Architecture forbids (e.g. domain
importing from infrastructure). Runs as its own CI job, in parallel with unit tests.

**Mutation tests:**
```bash
npm run test:mutation
```
> Runs Stryker against the domain + application layers only (see ADR-0020). Not part of the
push/PR pipeline — runs on a weekly schedule or manual `workflow_dispatch`, since it re-runs
the suite once per mutant and is too slow for every push.

> **E2E tests:** not implemented — see [ADR-0021](docs/architecture/adr/0021-e2e-testing-not-implemented.md).
Cypress was evaluated and removed; it has no working support for Angular's SSR/hydration
output in this app.

---

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output: `dist/smartcityfront/browser/` (static client bundle) and `dist/smartcityfront/server/`
(SSR Node bundle) — `ssr.entry` + `prerender` in `angular.json` split the build into these two
folders. Only `browser/` is deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Serve the SSR bundle:**
```bash
npm run serve:ssr:smartcityfront
```

---

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every push and pull request to `dev` or `main` runs the full pipeline on GitHub Actions.

> Mutation testing (`mutation-testing.yml`) is **not** part of this pipeline — it runs weekly or

Secrets required in the repository settings: `CODECOV_TOKEN`, `SNYK_TOKEN`, `SONAR_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`.

> **GitHub Pages setup:** the deploy job pushes the built client bundle (`dist/smartcityfront/browser/`) to a `gh-pages` branch via `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`. GitHub Pages must be configured in **Settings → Pages → Source** to serve from that branch, not from `main`. Without this, the deploy job succeeds but nothing is served. After deploy, the pipeline runs a smoke test that polls the live URL every 15 s to confirm the site is actually up.

## Environment Variables

Angular uses compile-time environment files under `src/environments/`.

| Variable | Description | Dev | Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| `production` | Enables Angular production mode | `false` | `true` |
| `apiBaseUrl` | Base URL of the SmartCity Backend REST API | `http://localhost:8080` | `https://smartcity-backend-9g09.onrender.com/SmartCityREST` |

Edit `src/environments/environment.ts` for local overrides.
**Do not commit secrets or private API keys to these files.**

---

## API Connection

Connects to the [SmartCity Backend](https://github.com/zaricu22/Domain-Driven-Backend) REST API.

Base URL is configured via `environment.apiBaseUrl`. Every request carries a `Bearer` JWT token attached by the `AuthInterceptor`.

> **Production backend is on Render's free tier and sleeps after inactivity.** The first request
after a period of no traffic can take up to 5 minutes to wake it up — a slow or timed-out first
call against [https://smartcity-backend-9g09.onrender.com](https://smartcity-backend-9g09.onrender.com) is expected, not a bug. Subsequent
requests respond normally once it's awake.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Authenticate, receive JWT |
| `GET` | `/v1/buildings/all` | List all buildings |
| `GET` | `/v1/buildings/:id` | Get building by ID |
| `POST` | `/v1/buildings` | Create building |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/buildings/:id` | Delete building |
| `POST` | `/v1/buildings/:id/devices` | Add energy device |
| `PUT` | `/v1/buildings/:id/consumption` | Update consumption |

### Presentation Layer Organization

Every `presentation/` folder (both `asset/` and `shared/`) follows the same four-way split:

| Folder | What goes here | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `layout/` | Persistent chrome rendered around `<router-outlet>` on every route | `Shell`, `Header`, `Footer` |
| `page/` | Route-level components — one per route, injects the Facade, owns page state | `BuildingListComponent`, `BuildingDetailComponent`, `LoginComponent` |
| `component/` | Embedded or reusable presentational components — no route of their own | `BuildingCard`, `DeviceList`, `EnergyDisplay`, `Toast`, `EmptyState` |
| `dialog/` | Modal overlays, conditionally rendered (not routed), closed via a result `Observable` (see ADR-0013) | `CreateBuildingDialog`, `AddDeviceDialog`, `ChangeConsumptionDialog` |

`asset/` only has bounded-context-specific pages/components/dialogs; 
`shared/` holds the chrome plus components reused across bounded contexts. 
`pipe/`, `directive/`, `service/` live next to `shared/presentation` because they support presentation but aren't components themselves.
